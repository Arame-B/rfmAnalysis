ðŸ›’ RFM Analysis in Python
This project shows how to do RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis.
RFM helps us group customers by how they buy things.
It is used in marketing to find the most important customers.

ðŸ“Œ What is RFM Analysis?
* Recency (R) â€“ How recently a customer bought something.
* Frequency (F) â€“ How often a customer buys.
* Monetary (M) â€“ How much money a customer spends.

  We give each customer a score for R, F, and M.
  Then we put scores together to see what type of customer they are:

* Best Customers â€“ buy often and spend a lot.
* Loyal Customers â€“ buy often but maybe spend less.
* At Risk â€“ used to buy but not now.
* Need Attention â€“ maybe small buyers, we want them to buy more.
